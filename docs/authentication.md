# Authentication Implementation

## Token Storage Approach

In this application, we use **localStorage** to store the authentication token. Here's why we chose this approach and how it works:

### Why localStorage?

1. **Persistence**: localStorage persists even after the browser is closed, providing a better user experience
2. **Simplicity**: Easy to implement and use
3. **Accessibility**: Can be accessed from anywhere in the application
4. **Sufficient Security**: For this application's use case, localStorage provides adequate security

### Alternative Approaches

#### Cookies
- **Pros**: Can be set with HTTP-only flag for better security, automatic inclusion in requests
- **Cons**: More complex to implement, requires server-side coordination

#### Session Storage
- **Pros**: Automatically cleared when the browser tab is closed
- **Cons**: Less convenient for users who want to stay logged in

### Security Considerations

While localStorage is sufficient for this application, in a production environment with higher security requirements, consider:

1. Using HTTP-only, secure cookies
2. Implementing token refresh mechanisms
3. Adding additional security headers
4. Using HTTPS exclusively

### Implementation Details

The authentication flow is implemented as follows:

1. User enters IP address, username, and password in the login form
2. Application makes a POST request to `http://{ip address}:8000/token` with credentials
3. On successful authentication, the token is stored in localStorage
4. The application checks for the token on load to maintain login state
5. Users can log out, which removes the token from localStorage

### Code Structure

- `contexts/auth-context.tsx`: Manages authentication state and provides login/logout functions
- `components/LoginForm.tsx`: Handles the login form UI and authentication request
- `app/page.tsx`: Implements conditional rendering based on authentication status
- `components/TopBar.tsx`: Provides logout functionality
